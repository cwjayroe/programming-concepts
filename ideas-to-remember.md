# High level ideas to remember when programming

## Do not tightly couple your code
Try to  not make your classes and methods dependant on other pieces of your code. 

If you were to copy and paste your code (classes/functions/methods) into another project, how hard would it be to make it work?

## Make code easy to change
## Make code as easy to read as you can
## Functions should do one thing
## Classes should have one responsibility
## Dont judge others code too harshly
Everyone is just trying to do the best they can

But honestly most code is shit

## To some extent, judge code by its results
If its making money can it really be considered bad code?

## Everything in moderation, including moderation
Take your programming ideals seriously, but not too seriously

## When thinking about inheritance, also think about mixins, interfaces and composition
Inheritance isnt always considered a good thing. It can bring along many unwanted or unneeded functions.

You wanted a banana but got a gorilla holding a banana, and the entire jungle.
